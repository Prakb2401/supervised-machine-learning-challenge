### Supervised Machine Learning Challenge

## General Information
In this challenge we started to learn about Machine Learning. For this challenge I got csv dataset and conducted the processes of supervised machine learning. After importing the csv I made a predicition if Logitical regression model or the Random forest classifier would be a more accurate model for this. After that I train, test, split the data and conducted the LRM and the RFC and found that the RFC was the more accurate model.

## Technologies Used
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas
* Logistical Regression Model
* Random Forest Classifier
